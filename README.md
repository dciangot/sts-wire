# STS WIRE 

## Requirements

- fuse installed

## Installation and usage

Download the binary from the latest release on [github](https://github.com/DODAS-TS/dodas-go-client/releases). For instance:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DODAS-TS/sts-wire/releases/download/v0.0.10/sts-wire
chmod +x sts-wire
cp sts-wire /usr/local/bin
```

To use it, you need to provide an instance name (of your choice, it is just for storing IAM client configuration, e.g. `myminio`), the path to your bucket or to root `/`, and finally the mount point destination (in this example `./mountedVolume`):

```
IAM_SERVER=<you iam server url> ./sts-wire  myminio <e.g. https://myserve.com:9000/> / ./mountedVolume
```

Follow all the instructions, providing a password for credentials encryption when requested.
Eventually, if everything went fine, on your browser you will be prompted with a message like:

```
VOLUME MOUNTED, YOU CAN NOW CLOSE THIS TAB. 
```

The volume will stay mounted untill you exit the running sts-wire process with Control-C

## Quick start

## Building from source

To compile on a linux machine (go version that supports `go modules` is required for building from source: e.g. >= v1.12):

make macos-build
```
